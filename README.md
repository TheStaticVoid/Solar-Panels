# Solar Panels

This is a simple solar panel mod for Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 (and in the future 1.20.X) that features five tiers of solar panels that are highly customizable. The mod adds three new components for the crafting of the solar panels, the Solar Voltaic Cell, Solar Casing, and Solar Batteries. I recommend using REI/JEI/EMI for viewing the recipes.

This mod was made to address a lack of a standalone solar mod with easy customization on the Fabric mod loader. As such, I do not plan to port this mod to Forge, as there are plenty of options there already.

## Textures
The texture for the solar panels are based off the ZedTech texture pack and were modified by [Flyte-less](https://github.com/Flyte-less/) for inclusion in this mod.

The textures for solar voltaic cells and solar batteries were made by [DeadeyeDutch](https://github.com/JordanVanB)

The solar panel GUI was made by me
